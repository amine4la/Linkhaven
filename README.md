# SurfShield

SurfShield helps users spot risky websites before they trust them.

It runs quietly in the browser and shows a clear warning when a page looks suspicious.

## Highlights

- Real-time website risk signals
- Clear, modern warning experience
- Lightweight and privacy-conscious approach

## Checks ran on every single link

- Insecure connection (`http` instead of `https`)
- Suspicious credential formatting inside the link
- Encoded null-byte patterns
- Encoded control-character patterns
- Unusually long domain names
- Lookalike domains (brand impersonation patterns)
- Suspicious phishing-style keywords in domain names
